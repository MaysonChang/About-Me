Description: Proposes a new two-step synthetic control (TSSC) method that comprises a new test for the parallel trends assumption using the pretreatment data in the first step, and the application of an appropriate form of synthetic control method in the second step. Thus, our approach unifies the synthetic control (SC) and the modified synthetic control (MSC) methods. For more information, please refer to the paper Estimating the Causal Effect of A digitally Native Retailer Opening a New Store: A New Two-Step Synthetic Control Method (Li and Shankar, 2020).
