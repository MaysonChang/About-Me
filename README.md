# About-Me
I am Chi Zhang, an enthusiastic learner and serious researcher in Applied Statistics and Causal Inference. I got my Bachelor of Agricultural Economics in Nanjing, China and am now pursuing a master's degree in Economics at University of Texas, Austin. Keen on mining information behind data sets, I am applying for the Ph.D. programs in Statistics in this season.

Here in UT Austin, I got the chance to explore my interested areas and conduct some projects with excellent faculty and peers. I hope to build up profound understand of the field and advance my analytical skills. I would like to transfer my knowledge and experience, as well as bring about changes to the academic research in relevant areas.

Here, I set up a repository for sharing the whole picture of my previous projects. Hope you could know more about me by taking a look at them.
